# Veilpad

A browser-only tool that hides likely secrets (API keys, passwords in config lines, private key blocks, JWTs, emails, phone numbers, IP addresses, card numbers and Korean resident IDs) before you paste text into an AI tool, and puts the original values back into the AI's reply. Static site, no server of its own, no AI API calls, no upload. 5 languages (en, ko, ja, zh, es).

Working name: the folder and the product name are not final. Check trademarks (KIPRIS / USPTO / EUIPO) before launch and rename the folder and `config.js` if needed. Names of AI and other companies appear only to describe what the patterns detect, and the landing page carries a non-affiliation notice.

## What it does

- **Hide details**: finds the values with patterns and checks (Luhn for card numbers, digit counts for phones) and replaces each with a numbered tag such as `[EMAIL_1]`. The same value always gets the same tag. The app lists what was found, with a partly masked preview.
- **Restore**: paste the AI reply into the restore box and the tags become the original values again. Only tags from the most recent "Hide details" on the page can be restored.
- **Copy** the masked text or the restored text.
- **Nothing stored**: the text and the originals stay in memory on the page. Reloading clears them. Only the language and, after unlocking, the licence key are kept in `localStorage`.

## Layout

- `index.html`, `landing.css`, `landing.js`: landing page.
- `privacy.html`, `terms.html`: legal pages, text in `i18n.js`.
- `i18n.js`: all user-visible strings (five languages, same keys).
- `config.js`: `siteUrl`, `checkoutUrl`, `price`. Change these before launch.
- `app/`: the app. `core.js` is pure logic (no DOM, no network, no storage) and is unit-tested. `app.js` builds the UI with `textContent` and `value` only.
- `functions/api/license.js` + `lib/license-core.js`: Cloudflare Pages Function for the licence check (Lemon Squeezy License API). Same contract as Quotanest.
- `scripts/build.js`: writes `sitemap.xml` and `robots.txt`, and with `--dist` copies the public files to `dist/`.
- `test/`: `core.test.js` (detection, redact, restore), `license.test.js`.

## Tests and build

```sh
cd veilpad
node --test test/*.test.js
node scripts/build.js --dist
```

## Deploy

`../.github/workflows/deploy-cloudflare.yml` tests, builds and deploys this folder to a Cloudflare Pages project named `veilpad` on pushes to `main`. The project must exist first (Cloudflare dashboard → Workers & Pages → Create → Pages → Direct Upload, name `veilpad`). Then set these variables on the project (Settings → Variables and Secrets):

- `LEMONSQUEEZY_PRODUCT_ID`: pins licence keys to this product.
- `LEMONSQUEEZY_DISABLED`: set to `1` to answer `configured: false`, which keeps the app open (the state before the product is on sale).

Before launch, set `checkoutUrl` in `config.js` to the Lemon Squeezy checkout link and `price` to the one-time price, then push.

## Behaviour when not on sale

If the server answers `configured: false`, the app opens without a key. If licensing is configured, the app shows the unlock screen, and a valid active key unlocks it on that device only.

## Known limits

- Detection is pattern based. It can miss secrets in unusual formats and can flag harmless numbers, so the output must be checked before sharing.
- Restore works only in the same page session. Reloading clears the originals.
- Names are not detected (a person's name is not a pattern), and free text such as addresses is not detected.
